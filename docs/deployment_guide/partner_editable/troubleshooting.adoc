=== Event Broker Logs

Both PubSub+ host and container logs get logged to Amazon CloudWatch on the region where the deployment occurred. 

* The initialization logs of the EC2 virtual machines that host the PubSub+ broker instances can be found under the `*/cloud-init-output.log` log stream.
* The event broker logs can be found under the `*/solace.log` log stream. The "ContainerLoggingFormat" deployment parameter can be used to control the log output format.
