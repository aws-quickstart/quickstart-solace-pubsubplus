.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/solace-pubsub-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones. If you deploy the Partner Solution in an AWS Region that has only two Availability Zones or you choose to use only two Availability Zones, the backup and monitoring instances of the message broker will be placed in the same Availability Zone.*
+
NOTE: We recommend using three Availability Zones, where available, for production systems.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** A single PubSub+ event broker instance that is assigned an HA role in each private subnet. For auto-recovery, these instances are set up with Amazon CloudWatch alarms. Docker is installed on each message broker instance, and the message broker image is installed and executed within a Docker container.
* Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer support with health checks (using Network Load Balancer).
* CloudWatch logging support, including the log file /tmp/install-solace.log, which logs the events during installation.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

NOTE: For non-production test or proof-of-concept (PoC) environments, you can choose to omit the private subnets. In that case all components in the private subnets will be deployed in the public subnets and no Linux bastion host will be required. There will be also no Load balancer deployed, all PubSub+ event brokers will have public access.
