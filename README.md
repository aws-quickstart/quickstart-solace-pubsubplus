## Solace PubSub+ Software Event Broker on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys Solace PubSub+ Software Event Broker version 9.13 or later on the AWS Cloud in a highly available (HA) cluster.

The Solace event broker is an implementation of the Solace SolOS messaging technology that runs on general-purpose processors in data centers, developers’ laptops, Internet of Things (IoT) gateways, the cloud, and other enterprise environments.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy a fully configured Solace PubSub+ event broker HA cluster in your AWS account. The Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying the Solace event broker cluster into a new VPC
- Deploying the Solace event broker cluster into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
