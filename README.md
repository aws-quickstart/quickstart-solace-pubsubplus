# quickstart-solace-vmr
## Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR) on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR) version 8.7 or later on the AWS Cloud in a highly available (HA) cluster.

The Solace VMR is an implementation of the Solace SolOS messaging technology that runs on general-purpose processors in data centers, developers’ laptops, Internet of Things (IoT) gateways, the cloud, and other enterprise environments.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy a fully configured Solace VMR HA cluster in your AWS account. The Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying the VMR cluster into a new VPC
- Deploying the VMR cluster into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
